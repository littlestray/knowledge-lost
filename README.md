# knowledge-lost

## Working abstract:
This is a project involving likely-bad-faith deletions from Wikipedia and
programmatic art (visual/arual) developed there from. It will explore the
curious fleeting dreams of petty, though potentially passionate, 
disagreement of the users of a system of collective knowledge. It will 
focus on the losses. It will focus on the underbelly, and unvouched for.
